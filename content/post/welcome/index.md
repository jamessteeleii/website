Welcome to my website... despite having a 'online presence' for the best part of the last decade, I've continually put off developing and maintaining my own website.

So what can you expect from this site?

For starters, it will act as a central hub linking towards all of my other online platforms and ways of being contacted ([email](mailto:james@steele-research.com), twitter, researchgate, open science framework, google scholar, github, linkedin etc.)
