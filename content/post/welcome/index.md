Welcome to my website... despite having a 'online presence' for the best part of the last decade, I've continually put off developing and maintaining my own website.

So what can you expect from this site?

For starters, it will act as a central hub linking towards all of my other online platforms and ways of being contacted ([email](mailto:james@steele-research.com), [twitter](https://twitter.com/JamesSteeleII), [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James-Steele-14), [open science framework](https://osf.io/vjrqk/), [google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=kvSD7D4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [github](https://github.com/jamessteeleii), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-steele-b09a7355/) etc.). 

Further, it will be a place to share not only my work published via other mediums (e.g., pre-prints, peer reviewed publications, talks, podcasts etc.), but it will serve as a medium for me to publish other content through blog posts.

Finally, in the past year I've actually setup Steele Research as a limited company and am actively providing consultancy to both individuals and companies interested in enhancing their ability to specify and answer key research questions relating to their areas and industries. It is through this website that people will be able to contact me for inquiries about consultancy and arrange initial meetings to discuss needs and provide indications of cost.    

Over time I will be slowly adding more content to this site, so bear with me in the meantime... there will be some good stuff coming.
