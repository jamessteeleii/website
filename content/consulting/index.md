## 
With years of experience both leading, and supporting, research projects in both the private, public, and academic sectors, you will find me in a prime position to either support you directly in leveraging the greatest insights from your projects or able to direct you to the appropriate people/resources through my network.

Whether you are in the early stages of figuring out exactly *what* your project is, exploring concepts, identifying problems, and forming questions, need help in operationalising and identifying outcomes, experimental design, and planning analyses/modelling, or you have an existing data set that you want to yield additional insights from, I can support you.
